ðŸ“˜ Class 2 â€“ MongoDB CRUD & Operators

In Class No. 2 of my MongoDB learning journey (under the guidance of my instructor **Hafizullah Khokhar**), I explored how to perform CRUD operations and use important MongoDB operators.  
This class focused on inserting, updating, deleting, and querying documents using comparison, logical, and array operators.
