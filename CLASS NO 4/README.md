ðŸ“˜ Class 4 â€“ MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Operators

In Class No. 4 of my MongoDB learning journey (under the guidance of my instructor Hafizullah Khokhar), I learned how to use the aggregation pipeline to analyze, transform, and reshape data efficiently. This class helped me understand how MongoDB processes data through multiple stages to generate meaningful results.

âœ… Topics Covered

ðŸ”¹ Understanding the concept of the Aggregation Pipeline
ðŸ”¹ Using stages like $match, $project, $addFields, $group, $sort, and $limit
ðŸ”¹ Performing mathematical calculations and field transformations
ðŸ”¹ Grouping and summarizing data with $avg, $sum, and $count
ðŸ”¹ Conditional logic using $cond
ðŸ”¹ Combining multiple operations into one powerful query

ðŸ§  Key Learnings

âœ” How to process data step-by-step through multiple stages
âœ” How to add, remove, and modify fields dynamically using $addFields and $project
âœ” How to calculate and group data for reports or summaries
âœ” How to sort, limit, and filter results effectively
âœ” Improved understanding of data pipelines for real-world analytics
