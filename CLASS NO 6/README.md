🎓 Class 6 – Advanced MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Operators

In Class No. 6 of my MongoDB learning journey (under the guidance of Instructor Hafizullah Khokhar at Aptech Pakistan Institute), I explored advanced aggregation operators that help connect, expand, and export data efficiently between multiple collections.

This class helped me understand how MongoDB handles relationships, array expansion, and result output — making data pipelines even more powerful and flexible.

✅ Topics Covered

🔹 Using $unwind to expand arrays into individual documents
🔹 Performing joins between collections using $lookup
🔹 Adding new calculated or transformed fields using $addFields
🔹 Skipping records for pagination with $skip
🔹 Exporting final results into new collections using $out

🧠 Key Learnings

✔ Learned how to break down array fields into multiple documents using $unwind
✔ Understood how to combine data from multiple collections with $lookup
✔ Practiced adding custom or computed fields dynamically using $addFields
✔ Explored how to paginate or skip data for cleaner result sets using $skip
✔ Learned to store pipeline results into a new collection with $out
✔ Improved confidence in building multi-stage aggregation pipelines for real-world data analysis

🧩 Example Practice Topics

📘 Joining students and courses collections using $lookup
📘 Expanding student course lists with $unwind
📘 Adding new computed fields such as total marks using $addFields
📘 Skipping initial records to implement pagination using $skip
📘 Exporting processed data to a new collection using $out
