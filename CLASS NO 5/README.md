# 📘 Class 5 – MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Operators

In **Class No 5** of my MongoDB learning journey (under the guidance of **Instructor Hafizullah Khokhar**), I explored how to use the **Aggregation Pipeline** to analyze, transform, and reshape data efficiently.  
This class deepened my understanding of how MongoDB processes data through **multiple stages** to produce powerful and meaningful analytical results.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- 🔹 Understanding the concept of the **Aggregation Pipeline**  
- 🔹 Using stages like **$match**, **$project**, **$addFields**, **$group**, **$sort**, and **$limit**  
- 🔹 Performing **mathematical calculations** and **field transformations**  
- 🔹 Grouping and summarizing data using **$avg**, **$sum**, and **$count**  
- 🔹 Applying **conditional logic** using **$cond**  
- 🔹 Combining multiple stages into one powerful query for data analysis
